// THis is how you comment in JS
// JS uses camelcasing, not snake casing exampleVariableName
// console.log("Hello World");
// alert("Hello World");

// You can prompt for input in an alert like this
playerName = prompt('What is your name?');

// You can also use the console to prompt for input
// playerName = console.log('What is your name?');
